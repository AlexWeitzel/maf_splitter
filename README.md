# maf_splitter
the purpose of this is to be able to run bash scripts inside docker containers. Basically, calling split_count_concat_maf.sh e.g. ./scripts/outside_docker/split_count_concat_maf.sh -s subset -i ./scripts/inside_docker/ -o ./chr5_test_mafs/ -c ./output/peak_maf_size.txt -t ./output/concat.maf from the ./ directory, and passing in flags for subset, input, output_dir, count location, and concat location will start the necessary docker images to tet this to work

run_phast.sh is just a way to run any command from within on the phast container. I am still learning, and there is probably a wayyyy more lightweight way to do this
